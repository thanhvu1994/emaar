Please report it on [lidplay.net/#feedback](https://lidplay.net/#feedback) **and please do not on the wordpess.org forums, thanks.**

= Why player with ads? =

The answer is simple. All video traffic passes through our servers.
Therefore, we are forced to place advertising in the player in order to pay for video traffic.
